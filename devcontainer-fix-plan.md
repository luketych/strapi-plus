# DevContainer Fix Plan

## Changes Made

1. Network Configuration
   - Changed from external `strapi_net` to local `strapi` network
   - Aligned with main docker-compose.yml configuration
   - Added bridge driver specification

2. Environment Files
   - Fixed typo in .env.devcontainer reference
   - Confirmed .env.devcontainer exists with required variables
   - Environment variables properly configured for both services

## Next Steps

1. Test the configuration:
   ```bash
   # First, ensure no conflicting containers are running
   docker compose down
   
   # Then rebuild and start the dev container
   ```

2. Potential issues to watch for:
   - Port conflicts (1337 and 5433)
   - Network connectivity between containers
   - Volume mount permissions
   - Environment variable propagation

3. Fallback plans if issues persist:
   - Try using bind mounts instead of named volumes for better development experience
   - Consider simplifying the configuration by removing the extends
   - Validate database connectivity separately from the application

## Testing Strategy

1. Database Connectivity
   - Verify PostgreSQL container starts
   - Test connection from host machine
   - Validate credentials and port mapping

2. Strapi Application
   - Check container startup
   - Verify file mounting
   - Test development server
   - Validate hot reloading

3. Network Communication
   - Verify containers can communicate
   - Test external access to services
   - Validate port mappings

## Success Criteria

1. Dev container starts without errors
2. Database is accessible and properly configured
3. Source code changes are reflected immediately
4. All environment variables are properly propagated
5. Network communication works between services
