# DevContainer Build Error Fix - 2025-04-03

## Intent
Fix the DevContainer build error that was occurring due to incompatible Node.js installation in Alpine Linux environment.

## Changes Made
1. Removed the Node.js devcontainer feature from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
2. Kept the Git feature for version control support
3. Container now relies on Node.js installation from base Alpine image (node:18-alpine3.18)

## Known Considerations
- The solution relies on the Node.js version provided by the base Docker image
- Node.js version management through nvm is not available, but this shouldn't be an issue since we're using a fixed Node.js version in the Dockerfile
