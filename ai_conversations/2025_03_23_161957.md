# Dev Container Permission Fix

## Issue
When running the container in VSCode Dev Containers, the `postCreateCommand` fails with permission errors:
```
chown: /app/.git/objects/95/3470ba1e4938417ba09a95bca13aac6ae5ffd7: Permission denied
chown: /app/.git/objects/59/7c50f6ac5c112413603134a3f987e98a2c6e13: Permission denied
...
chown: /app/.cache: Operation not permitted
```

## Solution
1. Removed the `chown: 1000:1000` property from the volumes section in the main `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Modified the `postCreateCommand` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to exclude the `.git` directory from the ownership change

## Changes Made
1. Modified `docker-compose.yml`:
   - Removed `chown: 1000:1000` from the bind mount volume configuration

2. Modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
   - Changed `postCreateCommand` from `chown -R node:node /app && npm install` to `find /app -path /app/.git -prune -o -exec chown node:node {} \; && npm install`

This fix addresses the permission errors by:
1. Avoiding attempts to change ownership of the `.git` directory, which is often protected
2. Using the `find` command with `-prune` to selectively apply ownership changes to all files except those in the `.git` directory
3. Maintaining the original functionality of ensuring proper file ownership for the application files
