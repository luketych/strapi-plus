# DevContainer Environment Variable Loading Fix

## Intent
- Fix the environment variable loading issue in devcontainer setup
- The original initializeCommand was failing due to comments in .env file causing export errors
- Need to create a more robust solution that properly handles commented lines and inline comments

## Changes Made
- Created `.devcontainer/load-env.sh` script to properly handle .env file loading
  - Implemented bash script with proper comment handling
  - Added line-by-line processing with comment filtering
  - Added inline comment removal
  - Added empty line skipping
- Updated devcontainer.json to use the new load-env.sh script
- Made the script executable with chmod +x

## Known Issues/Considerations
- The script assumes .env file is in the project root directory
- While the script handles comments and inline comments, it may need further refinement if more complex .env file patterns are encountered
- Need to verify the script works correctly in the actual dev container environment
