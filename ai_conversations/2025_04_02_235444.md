# Docker Network Configuration Fix - 2025/04/02 23:54

## Intent
- Fix Docker network configuration issues where the "Strapi" network had incorrect project association and label mismatch
- Resolve the duplicate network definition between docker-compose.yml and .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml

## Changes Made
- Removed redundant network definition from .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml
- Network "Strapi" is now solely defined in the main docker-compose.yml file
- Services in .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml will use the network defined in the main file through service extension

## Technical Details
- The issue was caused by having the same network defined in both compose files
- When using `extends` in docker-compose, network definitions should typically only exist in the base compose file
- The .devcontainer setup inherits network configuration through service extension

## Related Files
- docker-compose.yml
- .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Docker should now correctly associate the network with the project
2. Network labels should be consistent
3. Services should be able to communicate properly within the network
