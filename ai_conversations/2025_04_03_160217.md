# AWS Credentials Configuration Fix

## Intent
- Fix AWS credentials loading issue that was preventing SDK from accessing credentials
- Improve security by moving hardcoded credentials to environment variables
- Set up proper configuration structure for AWS services

## Changes Made
- Added AWS credentials to .env file
- Refactored default.js to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- Added AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable alongside AWS_REGION to ensure proper region detection
- Updated docker-compose.yml to pass AWS environment variables to the Strapi container
- Created milestone record for tracking the security improvement

## Known Considerations
- AWS credentials are now properly isolated from version control
- Environment variables need to be properly set in production/deployment environments
- The AWS signed URL expiration time can be configured through environment variables, defaulting to 15 minutes if not set
- Docker containers must be restarted to pick up the new environment variables
