# DevContainer Configuration Fix

## Intent
- Fix VSCode devcontainer configuration issues preventing proper container startup
- Ensure consistency between devcontainer and main docker configuration
- Maintain working docker-compose functionality

## Changes Made
- Updated workspace folder path from `/app` to `/opt/app` in devcontainer.json
- Modified postCreateCommand paths to match new workspace folder structure
- Fixed database service name in devcontainer docker-compose.yml to match main configuration
- Updated volume paths in devcontainer docker-compose.yml to maintain consistency
- Ensured volume names match between devcontainer and main docker configurations

## Known Considerations
- The changes maintain compatibility with the existing docker-compose setup
- No changes were required to the main docker-compose.yml as it was correctly configured
- The fix assumes the base Dockerfile is configured to work with /opt/app as the workspace
