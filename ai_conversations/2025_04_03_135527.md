# AI Conversation: Environment Variables to Config Files Migration

## Intent
- Remove environment variables from the project and replace them with a structured configuration system
- Improve configuration management by organizing settings into logical sections
- Make the application more maintainable by centralizing all configuration

## Changes Made
- Created a new configuration system with environment-specific overrides
  - config/env/default.js for base configuration
  - config/env/development.js for environment-specific settings
  - config/index.js for loading and merging configurations
- Updated all application files to use the new config system
  - config/database.js
  - config/server.js
  - config/admin.js
  - config/plugins.js
  - src/extensions/upload/createShortLink.js
- Removed environment variable dependencies
  - Deleted .env and .env.example files
  - Removed .env volume mount from docker-compose.yml
  - Simplified docker-compose.yml environment variables

## Known Considerations
- Testing will be needed to ensure all configurations are properly loaded
- Production deployments will need to create a production.js config file
- AWS credentials and other sensitive data are now in version control, may want to consider a secure secrets management solution in the future
