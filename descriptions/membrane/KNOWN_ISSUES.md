# Devcontainer Notes

⚠️ Devcontainers currently broken

- Attempted to set up config-based environment, but VSCode can’t resolve config vars.
Was having issues with environment variables not being set in the .devcontainer even though they were working with the docker compose container. So I tried switching to config vars and ditching env files eand environment variables entirely.
